This desktop application is my final project for my training as an IT specialist in June 2022.
It is written in WPF and C# ASP.NET 5.0
The access of a transponder to various terminals is to be simulated.
The user can load the desired transponders and terminals, and test the access from any transponder to any terminal by clicking.
The evaluated data is displayed in a list.
A local MS SQL database was implemented to read out the required data for the simulation.
